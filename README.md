# Identifying Exoplanet Companions using Radial Velocity Data with Deep Learning

## Abstract
<p align="left">  In 1995, the radial velocity method was conceived to find the first extrasolar planet around a Sun-like star in the constellation Pegasus. This method has since been responsible for the detection of a huge number of planets over the past decades. NASA and other groups such as ESO and the SDSS, are amassing vast catalogs of radial velocity data for stars with instruments such as HARPS and MARVELS. The use of Non-Linear Least Squared Regression with the curve fitting function of SciPy helped to analyze radial velocity graphs to extract accurate orbital parameters of stars reflected in NASA's Exoplanet Archive. In this work, we utilized the XGBoost Classifier in order to label whether the orbital parameters for the first planet around a star has other companions through the theory of planet to planet interactions. If a certain star does not have any planets, its change in radial velocity is attributed to a spectroscopic anomaly or a presence of another star. Due to the small data set, the test set and the complete data set were used to evaluate the model's performance. Accuracy percentages as well as the F-measure scores of the model for each evaluation were calculated. After training, the model received an accuracy percentage of 61.7978% on the test set and 81.2004% on the entire data set. The average F-measure scores of the three labels on both evaluations reflect the accuracy percentages: 0.61 & 0.81 on the test set and complete data set respectively. These results substantiate the use of orbital parameters from radial velocity analysis and planet to planet interactions for the purpose of exoplanet companion identification. </p>
